# Tree Data Structures

This repository demonstrates essential concepts and implementations of **Tree Data Structures**. The collection of algorithms and techniques is aimed at showcasing my understanding and mastery over various tree-related operations, such as traversals, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and more.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Binary Tree Traversals**:
  - Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, BFS (Level Order), DFS
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
  - Insertion, Deletion, Search
  - Find Kth Smallest/Largest Element
  - Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
- **AVL Tree**:
  - Rotations and Balancing
  - Insertion and Deletion
- **Heap Sort**: Sorting using Max-Heap and Min-Heap
- **Balanced Trees**:
  - Checking if a tree is balanced
  - Constructing a BST from a sorted array
- **Additional Problems**:
  - Path Sum
  - Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree
  - Is Complete Binary Tree?

## Features

- **Comprehensive Code Implementations**: Each concept includes Python code with detailed comments and visual representations explaining the logic behind each operation.
- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Every operation is accompanied by an analysis of its time and space complexity.
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: The solutions demonstrate not only correct implementations but also an efficient approach to solving complex problems involving trees.
